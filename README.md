# VBA Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was 
- Refactor code
- Determine whether these stocks given are worth to invest or not
We used certain stock information(dataset) in the year 2017 and 2018 using VBA, but what if we want to use whole dataset of stock information?
Refactoring could make code run with alot larger dataset, faster, and efficient.


## Results

### Analysis
After Refactore code, execution times of the original script and the refactored script clearly different.

## Summary

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring code

- Advantage is that Refactoring leads to better quality code, Easier to Understand, Helps Programming run faster.
- Disavantage is we might have to retest functionality, and if existing code doesn't have proper test cases.  Also risky when application is big and I dont         understand how those functions work.


### Pros and Cons of Refactoring code

- Refactoring helps make our code run faster, and more organized. If need to change or put more dataset, it will make easier to edit it.  Also easier to catch and solve debugging.  Cons of Refactoring code was to change alot of functions that we used, so had to run few times that it work properly.  If I didn't have end result, I would spent alot more time to to this.
